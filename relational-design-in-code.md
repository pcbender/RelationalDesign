# Relational Design in Code and Creativity

What if coding wasn’t just logic, but relationship?

Relational Design invites us to see beyond isolated parts — to work with context, connection, and conversation. In code, this might look like writing with the reader in mind. In design, it means every element responds to its ecosystem.

Creativity, then, becomes less about expression and more about resonance.

The possibilities? Systems that adapt, projects that listen, tools that co-create. The shift is subtle but transformative: from building _at_ the world to building _with_ it.

This is just a test. But it’s also an invitation.
